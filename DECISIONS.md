# GammaForge — Decisions

Implementation-level design decisions made *during* the build, with their rejected
alternatives — in the spirit of the predecessor's documentation discipline (grand-plan
goal #8). This is distinct from `docs/GRAND_PLAN.md`'s own changelog, which tracks
*plan* revisions (architecture decisions made before code exists); entries here are
added as things actually get built.

**Convention:** newest entry last, short id (D001, D002, ...) so other docs can
reference it. **Backticks mean "this exists right now and should resolve"** — a real
file path or a real symbol in the installed package. Names being discussed
hypothetically (rejected alternatives, not-yet-built files, forward-looking examples)
use *italics* instead, deliberately, so the doc-staleness guard (D002 below) can trust
every backtick without a manual exceptions list.

### D001 — Build backend: hatchling, src layout

**Decision:** `pyproject.toml` uses hatchling as the build backend, with the package
under `src/gammaforge/`.

**Rejected alternative:** *setuptools* — works equally well for a src-layout package,
but needs more explicit configuration (a packages-find table) for the same result;
hatchling's defaults handle src-layout with no extra config.

**Rationale:** one less thing to get wrong in Phase 0; no other project constraint
favors setuptools specifically.

### D002 — Doc-staleness guard (C2) scope: `DECISIONS.md` only, not `GRAND_PLAN.md` or `PROGRESS.md`

**Decision:** the Phase-0 doc-staleness smoke test (`tests/test_doc_staleness.py`)
only checks backticked identifiers in `DECISIONS.md` against the repo/installed
package. `GRAND_PLAN.md` and `PROGRESS.md` are explicitly excluded.

**Rejected alternative:** checking every doc under `docs/` plus `PROGRESS.md`.

**Rationale:** the guard's purpose (per the plan's own risk table, §12) is catching
*backward* drift — docs that used to be true and silently stopped being true, the
failure mode observed in the predecessor repo's *AGENTS.md* (a different repo — not
a claim checked against this one). `GRAND_PLAN.md` is a forward-
looking roadmap by design: most of its backticked identifiers (e.g. *LaserField*,
*fit_gaussian_paraxial*) intentionally name things that don't exist yet and won't until
their assigned phase lands — checking it now would fail universally, not usefully.
`PROGRESS.md` is a narrative session log that mixes "what we did" with "what we just
decided," so it has the same problem in miniature. `DECISIONS.md` entries are only
added once a decision is actually implemented, so it's the one doc where "every
backtick resolves" is true by construction *and* worth mechanically enforcing as things
get renamed later. The check can grow to cover more docs (e.g. a future API reference)
once they exist and follow the same after-the-fact convention.

---

### D003 — Phase 0 package skeleton: subpackage `__init__.py` only, no placeholder module files

**Decision:** Phase 0 creates six subpackages under `src/gammaforge/` — `io`,
`engines/xigma`, `engines/analytical`, `engines/kascade`, `validation/references`,
`gui` — each with a docstring-only `__init__.py`. It does not pre-create the
individual module files the plan names for later phases (e.g. *schema.py*, *beam.py*,
*laser.py*, *stages.py*, *collision.py*).

**Rejected alternative:** stub out every module file the plan names now (empty, or
raising *NotImplementedError*), so the full tree matches the plan's layout from day
one.

**Rationale:** an empty *schema.py* sitting in the tree for the whole of Phase 0 either
looks finished (misleading) or needs a marker comment nobody will remember to remove.
Phase 1's own exit criteria (round-trip tests, schema validation tests, ...) are the
actual definition of "the schema module exists" — better for a file's existence to mean
something than to pre-populate the tree for cosmetic completeness.
